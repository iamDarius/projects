# Random Side Projects

### Objective: 
This project is intended to create a calculator that calculates sleep debt. The program will ask a user how many hours of sleep is ideal each night, then compare that to the actual hours they slept each night of the last week.

Then, it will calculate the amount of hours over or under they are to their sleep goal.
